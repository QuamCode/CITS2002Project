When spawing a new process:
create the new (child) process
append the new process to the READY queue (NEW→READY)
append the current (parent) process to the READY queue (RUNNING→READY)


TODO LIST
	Define a queue data-structure to store the processes in READY, RUNNING, BLOCKED states and execute sequentially
	Define all of the system call types, spawn, read, write, sleep, wait, and exit
	Create a function to take a device name and amount to read/write and return a calculated time in microseconds
	
	Execute all the commands one by one


1. Read both files sysconfig and commands
2. Store respective in data-structures for further access - DONE

    ie shortsleep may look like:
        sleepCallObject:
            amountOfTimeToSleep: 100000
        
        commandObject:
            name: shortsleep
            systemcalls: [sleepCallObject, exitCallObject]
